      <article className="py-6 mt-32">We started this organisation because we felt that there are people in this world who dream to live a life that we are living right now. While we dream of luxuries, they just hope to get a life with basic needs. Education, Awareness and Hygiene are those basic needs. We can give something to the society, by helping the needy. For that, we felt education was the right tool, to eradicate slavery and disguised unemployment. So, the main reason to join hands was to push someone to get a better life. In a larger picture, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) are incorporated for the same, so we started to work on the UNSDG Goals Implementation
      We firmly believe that " The change we start now in this society may not bring a huge impact. But we are sure it will change the mindsets of the upcoming generations and make this world a better place to live
